## Project

### Project 3.1

> Write a perl program that reads an object file in this format and stores the contents in a suitable form in perl
> tables and arrays, then writes the file back out. The output file need not be identical to the input, although it
> should be semantically equivalent. (For example, the symbols need not be written in the same order they were read,
> although if they're reordered, the relocation entries must be adjusted to reflect the new order of the symbol table.)

> [!NOTE]
> Instead of using Perl I'll be doing the project in Python.
